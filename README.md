# Changing the aspect ratio of an image using Deep Neural Networks

Images are created in differet sizes and aspect ratio. Altering the aspect ratio of an image leads to deformation of the objects in the image. To overcome this problem, different methods have been proposed. We use a deep learning approach to change the aspec ration of an image while keeping the main objects of the original image unchanged.

## Proposed method
We use a DFNet work to rescale images (change size and aspect ratio). The code for DFNet is adopted from

```
https://github.com/hughplay/DFNet
```

The folder "InteliMageResizingApp" contains the web app for the rescaling images

The rescalig files and model can be found in "scaling_script" folder
